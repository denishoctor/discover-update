                      While the desire to hear the pitter patter of little
                      kitten feet can be strong, it's important to
                      <em>
                        paws
                      </em>
                      and make sure that now is the right time. While cats are
                      renowned for being independant creatures, they still
                      require plenty of time, attention and care. The time you
                      invest in your kitten when they're young will ultimately
                      pay off in the long run. And by long run, we mean up to 20
                      years! That's right, some cats have been known to live as
                      long as 18 - 20+ years.

                    <p>
                      If you choose to go down the route of obtaining your
                      kitten from a breeder, be selective about who you contact.
                      While less common than puppy farms, kitten farms do
                      operate in Australia and should be avoided at all costs. A
                      kitten farm is a large scale breeding operation where
                      large numbers of cats are kept in inhumane, intensive
                      conditions (eg. caged). Kitten farms are run purely with a
                      focus on profit at the expense of the cats' wellbeing and
                      are widely condemned by veterinarians and animal welfare
                      groups.

                      </b>
                      - A responsible cat breeder will put the health and
                      wellbeing of their breeding queens first. They ensure that
                      the cats and kittens are fed a good quality diet and kept
                      up to date with all healthcare needs. Good breeders also
                      screen cats for any known inherited defects prior to
                      breeding to avoid passing these on to the kittens.
                      Wherever possible if you are considering purchasing a
                      kitten from a breeder, ask to come and visit and meet them
                      and the parents in person. Not only will meeting the
                      parents and kittens give you a better idea of their
                      temperament, it will also allow you to gauge the kind of
                      environment your kitten is being bred and raised in.

                    <p>
                      When viewing a kitten, ask the breeder for evidence of
                      their microchipping and vaccination status, and check how
                      often they have been wormed.

                        Every year in Australia thousands of dogs and cats are
                        surrendered to animal shelters and pounds, with many of
                        these animals euthanized because a suitable home cannot
                        be found.

                      <p>
                        Before heading to a pet store or breeder, consider
                        whether you could instead offer a loving home to a puppy
                        or adult dog in need. Cats, kittens and other pets are

                  Kittens gradually wean off their mother's milk and begin to be
                  able to eat solid food from about 8 weeks of age, so this is
                  considered the minimum acceptable age for them to removed from
                  their mother.

                <p>
                  When you bring your new kitten home, try to bring some
                  unwashed bedding from their previous home with them so that
                  they can smell their littermates and old familiar environment
                  during this time of adjustment.

                  Confine your kitten to a small, safe area of the house to
                  begin with so that they don't get lost or hurt themselves and
                  can easily access their food, water and bed. As your kitten's
                  confidence levels grow you can begin to allow them to explore
                  more of the house and yard.

                  4. Should you keep your kitten Indoors, Outdoors or both?
                </h2>
              </summary>

              <div class="article-section-inner">
                <p>
                  It's important to consider whether your new kitten will live
                  totally indoors, outdoors, or spend a bit of time in both.
                  There are advantages and disadvantages to each and it pays to
                  think carefully about your location, proximity to main roads
                  and neighbours, and the risk of incidents such as dog attacks
                  and snake bites. The RSPCA advocates keeping cats exclusively
                  indoors for many reasons, all of which are highlighted in the
                  comparison table below.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whichever decision you make, we recommend implemeting the
                  living arrangements early on as cats are much more likely to
                  cope if they've been trained from a young age. Cats that have
                  always had access to the outdoors can quickly become
                  distressed if suddenly kept indoors, which can lead to
                  behavioural issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Indoor cats also don't have to live totally indoors - access
                  to an outdoor escape-proof enclosure is highly recommended to
                  provide environmental enrichment and stimulation. Directly
                  supervising your cat while outdoors is another way to help
                  reduce the risks, and if you don't have an escape-proof
                  backyard you can even train your cat to walk on a harness or
                  lead. Avoid walking your cat in places that may cause them
                  stress such as near main roads and where dogs are being
                  exercised.

              <div class="article-section-inner">
                <p>
                  It's perfectly normal for kittens to sleep about 15 to 20
                  hours a day! Remember that your kitten is doing a lot of
                  growing and developing, which means that he or she will need
                  plenty of sleep at night and daytime naps.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In general, night time is the most natural time for cats to be
                  active as dusk and dawn is typically when a cat would do most
                  of their exploring. You might find that your kitten is
                  especially active and playful when you arrive home from
                  work/school, as they have likely spent most of the day
                  relaxing and snoozing. Be sure to engage with them during this
                  time and have an assortment of toys handy.

                    Do cats hibernate? And does the season affect your cat's
                    sleep cycle?
                  </b>
                  - Some new pet owners are curious about whether winter weather
                  and shorter days can affect their cat's requirement for sleep.
                  Rest assured that just like humans, cats have a fairly
                  evergreen sleep requirement which is unaffected by the season.
                  Cats do not hibernate in winter, but they may be a little less
                  active if they are feeling cold.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In order to maximise your kitten's sleep and help him or her
                  settle quickly at night time, try to stick to a bedtime
                  routine, for example: dinner, playtime, and then into their
                  sleeping area.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Do Kittens Need A Cat Bed?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Cats will generally sleep where they like
                  <em>
                    (including your furniture!)
                  </em>
                  and every cat has a different preference. Some cats love
                  having a bed of their own and will use it every day, while
                  other cats prefer to simply sleep on the couch or in bed with
                  their human.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, all cats are naturally drawn to hidey holes and high
                  surfaces. This means that a cat tree or hideaway bed are
                  usually very well-utilised when provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In cooler weather, many cat owners notice their cat seeks out
                  cosy spots and may use a cat bed more frequently. Our top
                  recommendations for a winter cat bed include igloo beds, cat
                  caves, and furry bolster beds.

                <p>
                  Your kitten should already be microchipped before you adopt
                  them. In fact, most states require all pets to be microchipped
                  prior to rehoming by law.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  What is a microchip?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  In Australia, microchips are used for lifelong identification.
                  The microchip is a small metal chip the size of a grain of
                  rice. It gets inserted under the skin via a needle, in the
                  area between the shoulder blades or lower neck. The microchip
                  only contains one piece of information - a 12 digit number.
                  This number gets recorded in a central database, where your
                  contact details are then stored. Microchips can be scanned
                  with a special hand-held device at any vet clinic, pound, or
                  shelter.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Don't forget - your cat's microchip is for life. If you change
                  phone number, address, or email, always remember to update the
                  database. If your pet is ever lost, this may be the only means
                  of getting them safely back to you!
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Registration
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Depending on where you live, your cat may also need to be
                  registered with your local council or you could receive a
                  fine. Note that council registration often requires a
                  microchip number but does not happen automatically when your
                  pet is microchipped. To find out more about whether your cat
                  needs to be registered contact your local council.

                        Typical vaccinations for kittens involve 3 injections
                        spaced approximately 4 weeks apart. These usually occur
                        at:

                        However, this can vary depending on your location and
                        the type of vaccine your vet uses. Once the kitten
                        series has been completed your cat will need yearly
                        vaccinations for life.

                      <p>
                        In general, cats in Australia are routinely vaccinated
                        against Feline Calicivirus, Feline Herpesvirus and
                        Feline Parvovirus. Depending on your cat's level of
                        risk, your veterinarian may also discuss vaccination
                        against Feline Immunodeficiency Virus and Feline
                        Leukaemia Virus.

                      Heavy infestations with intestinal worms (roundworm,
                      hookworm and whipworm) in kittens can be life threatening
                      due to their small size and novice immune system. This
                      means that worming is an absolute must. Your kitten's
                      intestinal worming program should have already been
                      started by the breeder, shelter, or pet store by 4 weeks
                      of age.

                  Tapeworm
                </h4>

                <p>
                  Tapeworms are long flat worms that live in the intestines. The
                  two major species of tapeworms affecting pet cats in Australia
                  are the flea tapeworm (<em>Diplylidium caninum</em>) and
                  hydatid tapeworm (<em>Echinococcus granulosus</em>).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The flea tapeworm is picked up by cats who swallow infected
                  fleas while grooming. Once infected with the tapeworm, the cat
                  will pass tapeworm segments in their faeces. Sometimes these
                  segments may stick to the hair around your cat's rear end
                  causing them to bite, lick or scoot their bottom along the
                  ground. Flea tapeworms are unlikely to cause serious illness
                  in your cat and don't present a risk to humans but they do
                  have a significant 'ick' factor and are usually a sign of poor
                  flea control!
                </p>

                <p>
                  For cats in urban areas who are not fed raw offal or allowed
                  to consume animal carcasses, their risk of contracting Hydatid
                  tapeworm is low. Cats become infected by hydatid tapeworm by
                  eating cysts present in uncooked offal or meat. Once the
                  tapeworm reaches maturity in the intestines, it lays eggs
                  which are passed with the cat's faeces. While uncommon, this
                  tapeworm is important because if a human ingests one of these
                  eggs, they can go on to develop potentially life-threatening
                  hydatid cysts in their brain and other vital organs.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Heartworm prevention needs to be maintained for life, even for
                  exclusively indoor cats. The immature heartworm larvae are
                  spread via mosquitoes, which means it only takes one mosquito
                  to venture inside your home and bite your kitty to result in
                  infection.

                <p>
                  Monthly products usually combine heartworm with intestinal
                  worming and flea prevention, making prevention simple. Monthly

                <h4>
                  Fleas and ticks
                </h4>

                <p>
                  If your cat is 100% indoor, or you live outside of a tick
                  area, you generally don't need protection against paralysis
                  ticks. Paralysis ticks are present on most of the east coast
                  of Australia, and are most active in warm tropical and
                  subtropical areas, particularly during spring and summer. In
                  some areas of Queensland and New South Wales it is not
                  uncommon for cases of tick paralysis to be seen year round.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If tick prevention is not required in your area, we generally
                  recommend selecting one of the monthly combination products
                  above to ensure your kitty is still kept up to date with
                  protection against fleas, intestinal worms and heartworm. Flea
                  prevention is recommended year round to prevent flea eggs,
                  larvae and pupae building up in the environment. This helps to
                  avoid the sudden 'explosion' in flea numbers that can be seen
                  with the onset of spring.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If your cat does spend time outdoors and you are in a high
                  risk tick area, prevention is recommended with a product such
                  as
                  <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/cat/bravecto">Bravecto
                    Spot On</a>

                  protected from fleas and deadly ticks.

                  <h4>
                    How Does the Season Affect Parasites?
                  </h4>

                  <p>
                    As the season fluctuates, so too does the prevalence of
                    parasites. While intestinal worms tend to be prevalent all
                    year round, external parasites are very much affected by the
                    season. In Spring, fleas and ticks start to breed and become
                    much more numerous. Summer is also a high risk time for
                    fleas and ticks. In Winter, ticks aren't as much of a risk
                    but pesky mites and fleas can start posing a risk indoors.
                    As we start to heat our homes, the warm indoor air and the
                    use of thick, dusty blankets can stimulate dormant eggs to
                    hatch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Should you change parasite prevention depending on the
                    season? Ultimately, this depends on your pet and your area.
                    For example:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>
                      In Winter:
                    </b>
                    indoor cats may require stronger flea prevention,
                    particularly in cooler climates where the inside of the home
                    is heated regularly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>
                      In Summer:
                    </b>
                    extra diligence is needed with tick prevention if your cat
                    goes outdoors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To know for sure whether you should adapt your regime as the
                    new season unfolds, always check with your local vet. They
                    will know what parasites are a risk in your area.
                  </p>

                  <p>

                <p>
                  Did you know that cats can start breeding as young as four
                  months of age? Desexing your kitten before he or she reaches
                  sexual maturity (from 4 to 6 months of age) will prevent
                  unwanted pregnancies as well as reduce roaming behaviour and
                  territorial marking. Allowing your cat to roam outdoors prior
                  to desexing will increase their likelihood of falling

                  When to desex a kitten?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Most vets will recommend desexing your kitten at about 5 to 6
                  months of age, although in some cases kittens can be desexed
                  as early as 8 to 16 weeks depending on the size and breed of
                  the cat. RSPCA Australia supports early age desexing as an
                  effective way to reduce unwanted pregnancies and rehome cats
                  as soon as possible.

                  It's never too early to start thinking about your kitten's
                  dental health!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Your kitten will start teething from about 12 weeks as their
                  adult teeth start to come through. Most of the time owners
                  don't even notice these baby teeth fall out as they are often
                  swallowed, but don't be worried if you find the occasional
                  little tooth around the house!
                </p>

                <p>
                  When it comes to dental care, anyone who has owned a cat will
                  tell you that brushing their cat's teeth is much easier said
                  than done! With their little mouths and sharp claws, it can
                  save a whole lot of time and frustration if you start when
                  they're young. Tooth brushing is the best way to help prevent
                  dental disease and reduce the number of trips to the vet for
                  dental procedures. Try to get your kitten used to having their
                  mouth examined and handled from an early age.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Once all their adult teeth are through (usually by about 6
                  months), you can then upgrade to a

                  to get into the habit of a good dental routine.

                  There are heaps of options for pet insurance out there these
                  days, and they can be a fantastic way to ease the financial
                  stress of an expensive, unexpected illness or injury such as
                  cat bite abscesses, snake bite or cancer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It pays to do your research before you sign up for a pet
                  insurance policy, as not all are created equal. Be aware that
                  some policies may exclude certain common conditions (such as
                  cruciate ligament rupture) or limit the benefit paid in some
                  circumstances (for example, tick paralysis).
                </p>

                <h3>
                  The downside to pet insurance
                </h3>
                <p>
                  With pet insurance, one big issue that a lot of pet owners
                  have trouble with is the notion of 'pre existing conditions'.
                  Most, if not all, pet insurance providers will exclude the
                  majority of pre existing health conditions for life. This
                  means that if you take out your policy after your cat has been
                  diagnosed with a problem, for example allergic skin disease,
                  you will never be able to claim treatment for this condition
                  on your pet insurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On top of this, pet insurance companies can and do increase
                  your premiums as your pet ages, and if your pet has been
                  diagnosed with any medical conditions with your current
                  insurer, any new insurer will see these conditions as pre
                  existing and may well not cover them. Some companies can also
                  refuse to continue cover for cats once they reach a certain
                  age!
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>
                    So is pet insurance worth it?
                  </b>
                  From a vet's perspective, in some cases, sure. I have seen pet
                  insurance deliver the best value for money for young kittens
                  when the policy has been taken out before any accident or
                  illness has occurred. Kittens have a way of getting into
                  mischief and a pet insurance policy will go a long way when
                  faced with a hospital bill in the thousands for a cat who has
                  been hit by a car.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The bottom line here is to
                  <b>
                    research and compare
                  </b>
                  lots of different policies to see which would work best for
                  you. Ideally do this before you even get your kitten so you
                  know where you stand!
                </p>

                <p>
                  One alternative approach to pet insurance that some owners
                  prefer is to set up a pet savings account and arrange for a
                  small amount to be put aside from each pay cheque to cover any
                  unexpected vet expenses. This way, if you
                  <em>
                    don't
                  </em>
                  use your insurance, you'll at least have a nice bundle of
                  savings to fall back on!

                  Just like children, kittens will get up to all sorts of
                  mischief and can injure themselves in ways you could never
                  imagine. It pays to be extra vigilant with your kitten and
                  supervise them closely to help keep them out of trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some common sources of household injury or illness for kittens
                  include chewing power cables, obstruction of the digestive
                  tract with swallowed objects (sewing needles and thread,
                  buttons, toys etc.), tummy upsets from a change in diet and
                  poisonings from eating toxic items such as lilies and
                  chocolate. Just as you would with a human child, try as much
                  as possible to restrict your kitten's access to potential
                  dangers. It's also important to be wary of flea and tick
                  treatments that are only registered in dogs as some of these
                  can be toxic and life-threatening for cats. For example,
                  <b>
                    Advantix should never be used in cats
                  </b>
                  .
                </p>

                <p>
                  If your kitten appears lethargic, off their food, has vomiting
                  or diarrhoea or you suspect they may have eaten something they
                  shouldn't have, contact your local vet or after hours
                  emergency centre as soon as possible. In many cases early
                  treatment offers the most successful outcomes. Keep your vet
                  and their recommended after hours service's phone numbers on
                  the fridge or in your phone so you can access them quickly
                  when you need them.

                  13.1. Choosing the right food
                </h3>

                <p>
                  When it comes to choosing a diet to feed your kitten, it's
                  important to keep two things in mind. Firstly, kittens require
                  a diet that has been specifically formulated for their life
                  stage. These 'kitten' diets contain optimal levels of key
                  nutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins and
                  minerals to support their rapid growth and development.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Secondly, the chosen diet must be complete and balanced.
                  Unlike dogs, cats are obligate carnivores which means they
                  have an absolute requirement for animal protein as well as
                  certain amino acids such as Taurine. In general, you can
                  assess whether a diet is complete and balanced by looking for
                  an AAFCO statement (The American Association Of Feed Control
                  Officials) on the packaging or on the manufacturers website.

                <h4>
                  How long should you feed kitten food?
                </h4>

                <p>
                  Most kittens need to be fed a kitten food until they are 9-12
                  months of age. For most cats, the '12 months' rule applies,
                  but some cats (particularly those who were desexed early) may
                  start to become a little pudgy by 10 months, and these kitties
                  may benefit from a swap to adult food earlier than 12 months.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, large breed cats such as the Maine Coon and Norwegian
                  Forest Cat generally require a kitten diet for up to 13 - 15
                  months.

                <p>
                  Mixed feeding from an early age will help to discourage your
                  kitten from developing strict dietary preferences and allow
                  you to feed a range of diets. This may be important if they
                  need a specific diet for a health condition during their life.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  What about rotational feeding?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  For kittens, rotational feeding may have many benefits as it
                  provides exposure to different protein sources. Allowing
                  exposure to different types of food early on may even reduce
                  the chance of allergens developing later in life.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Plus, a rotation of flavours can help keep cats interested in
                  their food. In the wild, cats naturally vary their diet by
                  alternating the species of prey they choose to hunt; so
                  rotating between flavours and textures is a great idea to keep
                  them interested.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Rotation feeding basically involves keeping a number of
                  different balanced diets made from different protein sources
                  (fish, chicken, beef, etc) and swapping between them every few
                  days. We recommend choosing diets from a couple of different
                  brands to ensure a variety. (<em>
                    Also, alternating between different manufacturers can help
                    cover you in case any 'bad' or 'nutrient deficient' batches
                    are produced; which is rare but can happen from time to
                    time!
                  </em>)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Care needs to be taken with kittens who have a sensitive
                  stomach, so a slow introduction to this method is best. Your
                  kitty may experience some loose stool as their stomach
                  adjusts, but in the majority of cases they get used to it
                  fairly quickly.

                    13.3. When and how much to feed?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Kittens need to eat more frequently than adult cats, after all
                  they only have tiny little stomachs! Up until the age of about
                  5 to 6 months it's recommended to split your kitten's daily
                  feeding amount into 3 separate meals.
                </p>

                <h4>
                  How much to feed a kitten?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The ideal feeding amount will vary from formula to formula and
                  depends on your kitten's age and weight. To work out how much
                  to feed your kitten, consult the feeding guidelines on the
                  food packaging and use this as a starting point, adjusting the
                  amount up or down depending on your kitten's needs. If you
                  need help or aren't sure how much to feed, check with your
                  veterinarian or

                <p>
                  Just like puppies, kittens can be taught to perform a range of
                  activities and so it helps to start early. While petting and
                  grooming is a great way to bond and reward your cat, it helps
                  to have a stash of treats on hand to help with the training.
                  But how do you choose the best treat?

                      While bringing home a new kitten is an exciting time for

                      stressful time for the kitten. They're away from their
                      mother and siblings and placed into an unfamiliar
                      environment.

                <p>
                  In the first few days, limit your kitten's access to a few
                  rooms in the house and have all their essentials close by.
                  Within one of these rooms create a safe haven where they can
                  hide, rest, play, eat and use the litter tray comfortably.

                  Scratching is also a natural behaviour for cats, allowing them

                <h4>
                  How to toilet train a kitten
                </h4>

                <p>
                  Worried about how to toilet train your kitten? The good news
                  is, there's not a lot involved! Cats naturally value
                  cleanliness so toilet training is usually fairly
                  straightforward. It's worth asking the breeder or shelter
                  whether your kitten was using a litter tray prior to adoption,
                  as this will allow you to select a litter tray and litter they
                  are already familiar with. If you're not sure, you can offer a
                  bit of a smorgasbord of litter trays to see which one they
                  naturally prefer to use. There are a variety of
                  <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/litter-trays">litter
                    trays</a>
                  available nowadays, some of which include a
                  <a
                    href="https://storage.googleapis.com/product/feline-care-hooded-cat-litter-tray-with-door"
                  >hood</a>
                  for added privacy which can also help to contain odours. There
                  are even
                  <a
                    href="https://storage.googleapis.com/product/petsafe-scoop-free-litter-tray-self-cleaning-original"
                  >self cleaning litter trays</a>
                  available for the time precious pet parent! Make sure the
                  sides of the tray or entrance are low enough for them to get
                  over with ease, and place them in a quiet, private location
                  away from dogs, children and noisy appliances.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Place the litter tray within the safe haven we mentioned
                  earlier, and gently place them in the litter tray at opportune
                  times such as after playing, after each meal and waking up
                  from a nap. Kittens are also much more likely to use the
                  litter tray if it's clean (remember, they value cleanliness!)
                  so keeping the tray clean and promptly removing waste will
                  help encourage your kitty to toilet in the correct place. They
                  will have a few accidents while they learn so don't be
                  discouraged and importantly, never punish your kitten for
                  toileting outside the litter tray.
                </p>

                  15.1. Which cat litter is best for kittens?
                </h2>

                <p>
                  When young kittens are first weaned and are still learning to
                  use the litter tray, it’s not unusual for them to attempt to
                  eat the cat litter. For this reason it is not recommended to
                  use clumping clay (sodium bentonite) litters or crystal
                  litters, which can cause illness if ingested or inhaled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Look for biodegradable alternatives such as those based on
                  plant material or recycled paper which are much less likely to
                  do harm if taste tested.
                </p>

                  Grooming your new kitten is a great way to spend time and bond
                  with them. It also helps to control shedding, particularly
                  during the warmer months and reduces the development of
                  hairballs. Long haired cats such as the Ragdoll are particular
                  prone to the development of matts which can quickly become
                  painful and difficult to remove without clipping at your
                  groomer or vet clinic.

                <p>
                  The requirement for grooming will be a bit dependant on what
                  breed of cat you have, with long haired breeds requiring
                  brushing more frequently. For these breeds, we recommend
                  grooming daily with a

                  What time of year do cats shed?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Most people find that their cat sheds fur hair all year round,
                  but it can become particularly heavy in Springtime as the
                  weather warms up. Many (but not all) cats will start retaining
                  fur in Autumn and Winter, building up a thicker coat (known as
                  their 'fluffy winter coat'). Then they may start to lose this
                  in Spring. This means that you might need to increase the
                  amount of brushing when the weather warms up, to reduce excess
                  shedding on your furniture!
