                      While the desire to hear the pitter patter of little puppy
                      feet can be strong, it's important to pause and make sure
                      that now is the right time. Puppies are a lot of work and
                      you'll need plenty of patience and time to give them the
                      best start in life.

                    <p>
                      Remember that a puppy is for life and that cute little
                      ball of fluff will soon grow into an adult dog with a
                      lifespan of 10 to 20 years!

                    <h3>How to choose a dog breed that suits you</h3>

                    <p>
                      Wondering how to choose the best dog breed for your
                      family? When choosing a breed, think about your home and
                      lifestyle to determine what size and type of dog may be
                      the best fit for you. If you have your heart set on a
                      particular breed of dog, be sure to do your research
                      before you commit. Purebred dogs in particular can be
                      predisposed to a number of genetic health conditions and
                      it pays to be well informed before you bring one home.

                    <h4>Where to look and what to look for</h4>

                    <p>
                      If you choose to go down the route of obtaining your pup
                      from a breeder, be selective about who you contact.
                      Despite tougher regulations, puppy farms still operate in
                      Australia and should be avoided at all costs. A puppy farm
                      is a large scale breeding operation where large numbers of
                      dogs are kept in inhumane, intensive conditions (eg.
                      caged). Puppy farms are run purely with a focus on profit
                      at the expense of the dogs' wellbeing and are widely
                      condemned by veterinarians and animal welfare groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      A responsible dog breeder will put the health and
                      wellbeing of their breeding dogs first. They ensure that
                      the dogs and pups are fed a good quality diet and kept up
                      to date with all healthcare needs. Good breeders also
                      screen dogs for any known inherited defects prior to
                      breeding to avoid passing these on to the puppies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Wherever possible if you are considering purchasing a pup
                      from a breeder, ask to come and visit and meet them and
                      the parents in person. Not only will meeting the parents
                      and pups give you a better idea of their temperament, it
                      will also allow you to gauge the kind of environment your
                      pup is being bred and raised in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When viewing a puppy, ask the breeder for evidence of
                      their microchipping and vaccination status, check how
                      often they have been wormed and ask if any screening (such
                      as hip and elbow scoring or genetic testing) has been
                      performed on the pups or their parents.

                        Every year in Australia thousands of dogs and cats are
                        surrendered to animal shelters and pounds, with many of

                      The first 48 hours with a new puppy can be fun but
                      challenging, as your little one will need some time to

                      that they can smell their littermates and old familiar

                      Confine your puppy to a small, safe area of the house to
                      begin with so that they don't get lost or hurt themselves
                      and can easily access their food, water and bed. As your
                      pup's confidence levels grow you can begin to allow them
                      to explore more of the house and yard. There's no set age
                      when it is or isn't safe for a puppy to go outside into
                      the backyard, but make sure your pup is confident on their
                      own and can easily get to food, water and shelter before
                      you leave them outside for longer periods of time. Also be
                      mindful that your pup will need to have fully completed
                      all their vaccinations before it is safe to take them to
                      areas at higher risk of

                    <h5>Worried about bringing a new puppy home to another dog?</h5>
                    <p>
                      Thankfully dogs are pack animals, so they will usually
                      learn to get along fairly quickly. However, every dog has
                      a different personality and level of socialisation. Senior
                      dogs may have a lower tolerance for boisterous puppy
                      energy, and breeds of different sizes may take a little
                      longer to get used to one another. Introduce your puppy
                      carefully and under supervision to any existing pets in
                      the house to help get their relationship off on a positive
                      footing. For more information on how to do this, check out

                        1. Provide a safe space with all their essentials
                        <br />
                        2. Establish a routine as early as possible
                        <br />
                        3. Try to feed the same diet as the previous home, and
                        transition to any new food slowly
                        <br />
                        4. Try to bring home unwashed bedding from their
                        previous home, to provide a familiar smell
                        <br />
                        5. Consider placing a watch or clock in their bed to
                        mimic littermate heartbeats
                        <br />

                      Remember that your puppy is doing a lot of growing and
                      developing, which means that he or she will need plenty of
                      sleep and night and daytime naps. It's perfectly normal
                      for puppies to sleep about 15 to 20 hours a day!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In order to maximise your puppy's sleep and help him or
                      her settle quickly at night time, try to stick to a
                      bedtime routine, for example: dinner, a walk, playtime, a
                      toilet trip and then into the crate or sleeping area. It's
                      normal for your pup to wake during the night and need a
                      toilet break until about 16 weeks of age.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Do dogs hibernate?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Some new pet owners are curious about whether winter
                      weather and shorter days can affect their puppy's
                      requirement for sleep. Rest assured that just like humans,
                      dogs have a fairly evergreen sleep requirement which is
                      not affected by the season. Dogs do not hibernate in
                      winter, but they may be a little less active if they are
                      feeling cold.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Does my dog need a bed?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Dogs will naturally seek out a soft place to sleep, so a
                      comfortable dog bed of their own is always recommended.
                      Even if you're happy for your dog to sleep on the bed with
                      you, it's still a good idea to provide a bed on the ground
                      in case they feel hot or want a little extra room to
                      themselves.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For outside dogs, a kennel is important all year round as
                      it can provide shade on hot sunny days and a warm place to
                      curl up on cooler nights.

                      Your puppy should already be microchipped before you adopt
                      them. In fact, most states require all pets to be
                      microchipped prior to rehoming by law.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is a microchip?</h3>

                    <p>
                      In Australia, microchips are used for lifelong
                      identification. The microchip is a small metal chip the
                      size of a grain of rice. It gets inserted under the skin
                      via a needle, in the area between the shoulder blades or
                      lower neck. The microchip only contains one piece of
                      information - a 12 digit number. This number gets recorded
                      a central database, where your contact details are then
                      stored. Microchips can be scanned with a special hand-held
                      device at any vet clinic, pound, or shelter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Don't forget - your dog's microchip is for life. If you
                      change phone number, address, or email, always remember to
                      update the database. If your pet is ever lost, this may be
                      the only means of getting them safely back to you!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Registration</h3>

                    <p>
                      Depending on where you live, your dog may also need to be
                      registered with your local council or you could receive a
                      fine. Note that council registration often requires a
                      microchip number but does not happen automatically when
                      your pet is microchipped. To find out more about whether
                      your dog needs to be registered contact your local
                      council.

                      Typical vaccinations for puppies involve 3 injections
                      spaced approximately 4 weeks apart. These usually occur at
                      6-8 weeks of age, 12 weeks of age, and 16 weeks of age but
                      can vary depending on your location and they type of

                    <h3>Intestinal worming</h3>

                    <p>
                      Heavy infestations with intestinal worms (roundworm,
                      hookworm and whipworm) in puppies can be life threatening,
                      so worming is an absolute must. Due to their smaller size
                      and novel immune system, puppies are particularly
                      sensitive to parasite infestations. Your pup's intestinal
                      worming program should be started by the breeder, shelter,
                      or pet store by 4 weeks of age.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How often should I worm my puppy?</h4>
                    <p>
                      It's recommended to worm your puppy every 2 weeks until 12
                      weeks of age and then monthly till 6 months of age. After
                      6 months of age, intestinal worming should be done at
                      least every 3 months, although many owners prefer to worm
                      their dogs every month. Worming treatments may often be
                      combined with

                      for convenience.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Which wormer is best for my puppy?</h4>
                    <p>
                      When choosing a worming treatment for your puppy, check
                      with your veterinarian regarding their best
                      recommendations. Some areas of Australia have documented
                      resistance in hookworm species to the active ingredient
                      pyrantel, when used on its own. Intestinal wormers such as

                <h3>Tapeworm</h3>

                <p>
                  Tapeworm are long flat worms that live in the intestines, the
                  two major species of tapeworms affecting pet dogs in Australia
                  are the flea tapeworm (<em>Diplylidium caninum</em>) and
                  hydatid tapeworm (<em>Echinococcus granulosus</em>).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The flea tapeworm is picked up by dogs who swallow infected
                  fleas while grooming. Once infected with the tapeworm, the dog
                  will pass tapeworm segments in his faeces. Sometimes these
                  segments may stick to the hair around your dog's rear end
                  causing them to bite, lick or scoot their bottom along the
                  ground. Flea tapeworms are unlikely to cause serious illness
                  in your dog and don't present a risk to humans but they do
                  have a significant 'ick' factor and are usually a sign of poor
                  flea control!
                </p>

                <p>
                  For dogs in urban areas who are not fed raw offal or allowed
                  to consume animal carcasses, their risk of contracting Hydatid
                  tapeworm is low. Dogs become infected by hydatid tapeworm by
                  eating cysts present in uncooked offal or meat. Once the
                  tapeworm reaches maturity in the intestines, it lays eggs
                  which are passed with the dog's faeces. While uncommon, this
                  tapeworm is important because if a human ingests one of these
                  eggs, they can go on to develop potentially life-threatening
                  hydatid cysts in their brain and other vital organs.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When worming your dog or puppy look for an allwormer which
                  contains praziquantel (such as

                <h3>Heartworm</h3>

                <p>
                  Heartworm prevention needs to be maintained for life. You can
                  either choose to get a heartworm injection at your vet
                  (usually given at 12 weeks, 6 months of age, and then every
                  year), or you can give a monthly product yourself at home.
                  Monthly products usually combine heartworm with intestinal
                  worming, and some even combine flea and tick treatments in the
                  mix too!

                    <p>
                      Depending on the product, flea and tick prevention can be
                      started around 6-9 weeks of age. As previously discussed,
                      you can combine flea and tick protection with worming, or
                      you might like to give two separate products.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ask your vet about whether there are ticks, particularly
                      paralysis ticks, in your area. Paralysis ticks are present
                      along most of the east coast of Australia.
                    </p>
                    <h3>When is flea and tick season?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Fleas and ticks are most active in warm tropical and
                      subtropical areas, particularly during spring and summer.
                      In some areas of Queensland and New South Wales is not
                      uncommon for cases of tick paralysis to be seen year
                      round. While the need for tick prevention may be seasonal
                      in your area, we recommend that flea prevention is used
                      year round to prevent flea eggs, larvae and pupae building
                      up in the environment. This helps to avoid the sudden
                      'explosion' in flea numbers that can be seen with the
                      onset of spring.

                      Desexing your puppy before he or she reaches sexual
                      maturity (from 4 to 6 months of age) will prevent unwanted
                      pregnancies as well as reducing roaming behaviour and
                      territorial marking. Not only that, female dogs who are
                      desexed before their second heat have a significantly
                      reduced risk of mammary cancer and uterine infection. Male
                      dogs who are desexed are less likely to experience
                      prostate problems and are not affected by testicular
                      cancers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most vets will recommend desexing your puppy at about 5 to
                      6 months of age, although in some cases puppies can be
                      desexed as early as 8 to 16 weeks depending on the size
                      and breed of the dog. RSPCA Australia supports early age
                      desexing as an effective way to reduce unwanted
                      pregnancies and rehome dogs as soon as possible.

                    <p>
                      It's never too early to start thinking about your puppy's
                      dental health!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Your puppy will start teething from about 12 weeks as
                      their adult teeth start to come through. Most of the time
                      owners don't even notice these baby teeth fall out as they
                      are often swallowed, but don't be worried if you find the
                      occasional little tooth around the house!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      While they are teething your pup will probably start to
                      chew on
                      <b>everything</b>
                      , so make sure you give them plenty of appropriate chew
                      toys to save your shoes and furniture. Until your pup has
                      all their adult teeth avoid giving harder dental chews or
                      bones as baby teeth are a little more delicate and may
                      break if they chew hard objects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once all your pup's adult teeth are through (usually by
                      about 6 months), it's time to start thinking about how you
                      will care for their dental health throughout their life.
                      Veterinary dentists recommend daily tooth brushing as the
                      gold standard for dog dental care, and the earlier you
                      start the easier it will be for your dog to accept this.
                      Try to get your puppy used to having their mouth examined
                      and handled from an early age.

                      There are heaps of options for pet insurance out there
                      these days, and they can be a fantastic way to ease the
                      financial stress of an expensive, unexpected illness or
                      injury such as cruciate ligament rupture, snake bite or
                      cancer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It pays to do your research before you sign up for a pet
                      insurance policy, as not all are created equal. Be aware
                      that some policies may exclude certain common conditions
                      (such as cruciate ligament rupture) or limit the benefit
                      paid in some circumstances (for example, tick paralysis).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      One big issue with pet insurance is pre existing
                      conditions; most if not all pet insurance providers will
                      exclude the majority of pre existing health conditions for
                      life. This means that if you take out your policy after
                      your dog has been diagnosed with a problem, for example
                      allergic skin disease, you will never be able to claim
                      treatment for this condition on your pet insurance. On top
                      of this, pet insurance companies can and do increase your
                      premiums as your pet ages, and if your pet has been
                      diagnosed with any medical conditions with your current
                      insurer, any new insurer will see these conditions as pre
                      existing and may well not cover them. Some companies can
                      also refuse to continue cover for dogs once they reach a
                      certain age!
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="article-col">

                      src="./new-puppy-guide_files/new-puppy-guide-feature-21.jpg"
                    />
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h3>So is pet insurance worth it?</h3>
                <p>
                  From a vet's perspective, in some cases, sure. I have seen pet
                  insurance deliver the best value for money for young puppies
                  when the policy has been taken out before any accident or
                  illness has occurred. Puppies have a way of getting into
                  mischief and a pet insurance policy will go a long way when
                  faced with a hospital bill in the thousands for a pup who has
                  been hit by a car.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The bottom line here is to
                  <b>research and compare</b>
                  lots of different policies to see which would work best for
                  you. Ideally do this before you even get your puppy so you
                  know where you stand!
                </p>

                <p>
                  One alternative approach to pet insurance that some owners
                  prefer is to set up a pet savings account and arrange for a
                  small amount to be put aside from each pay cheque to cover any
                  unexpected vet expenses.

                      Just like children puppies will get up to all sorts of
                      mischief and can injure themselves in ways you could never
                      imagine. It pays to be extra vigilant with your pup and
                      supervise them closely to help keep them out of trouble.
                      Some common sources of household injury or illness for
                      puppies include chewing power cables, obstruction of the
                      digestive tract with swallowed objects (toys, socks,
                      underwear, door stops etc.), tummy upsets from dining out
                      on the garbage bin, drowning in swimming pools and
                      poisonings from eating toxic items such as chocolate, rat
                      poison and snail baits. Just as you would with a human
                      child, try as much as possible to restrict your pup's
                      access to potential dangers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If your pup appears lethargic, off their food, has
                      vomiting or diarrhoea or you suspect they may have eaten
                      something they shouldn't have, contact your local vet or
                      after hours emergency centre as soon as possible. In many
                      cases early treatment offers the most successful outcomes.
                      Keep your vet and their recommended after hours service's
                      phone numbers on the fridge or in your phone so you can
                      access them quickly when you need them.

                    <h3>When can puppies start to eat solid food?</h3>

                    <p>
                      Puppies gradually wean off their mother's milk and begin
                      to be able to eat solid food from about
                      <b>8 weeks of age</b>, so this is considered the minimum
                      acceptable age for them to removed from their mother.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      What your puppy eats in the first year of life has a
                      direct effect on their growth, skeletal development and
                      immune system. It also influences their risk of developing
                      obesity later in life. Puppy food has the right balance of
                      energy, protein, fat, calcium and phosphorus to help your
                      puppy develop properly, it is also highly digestible which
                      is good for sensitive stomachs. Depending on your puppy's
                      breed and size they will need to stay on puppy food from
                      10 to 24 months of age.

                <h3>What is the best puppy food?</h3>

                <p>
                  Puppies need special food to support their increased need for
                  energy, calcium and other nutrients during growth. Feeding
                  your pup a high quality puppy food in their first year of life
                  will set them up for a healthy life. Look for premium diets
                  based on scientific research and development from brands
                  including

                  Science based puppy foods are rigorously tested to ensure
                  safety, quality, nutritional soundness, palatability and
                  digestibility. The end result is food that tastes great, is
                  gentle on your pup's tummy and delivers everything they need
                  to grow and thrive.

                <p>
                  The most convenient and economical means of feeding your dog
                  is with dry food, although many owners like to offer a little
                  wet food as a treat or to aid hydration. The choice of whether
                  to feed wet food, dry food or a combination ultimately comes
                  down to you!

                </h2>

                <p>
                  Small and toy breed puppies (those with an expected adult
                  weight under 10kg) mature faster than medium and large breeds,
                  so choose tailored small breed formulas to ensure your pup's
                  unique nutritional needs are met.

                    <p>
                      Large and giant breed puppy diets have been formulated to
                      account for the rapid growth rate and heavier body weight
                      that is placed on their growing skeletons.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Large and giant breed puppy diets are less energy dense to
                      reduce the risk of overfeeding, because an overweight body
                      condition is an important risk factor for the development
                      of orthopaedic disease. These diets typically also have an
                      appropriate balance of calcium and phosphorus with a lower
                      overall calcium content than a regular puppy diet.

                      <b>For Large and Giant Breed Puppies, we recommend:</b>

                      marketed specifically for large or giant breed growth, and
                      has ideally undergo AAFCO feeding trials. Our top

                <p>
                  Puppies need to eat more frequently than adult dogs, after all
                  they only have tiny little stomachs! Up until the age of about
                  5 to 6 months it's recommended to split your puppy's daily
                  feeding amount into 3 separate meals.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Knowing how much to feed of a particular food can be tricky;
                  the ideal feeding amount will vary from formula to formula and
                  depends on your puppy's age and weight. To work out how much
                  to feed your puppy, consult the feeding guidelines on the food
                  packaging and use this as a starting point, adjusting the
                  amount up or down depending on your puppy's needs. If you need
                  help or aren't sure how much to feed, check with your
                  veterinarian or

                <h3>Treats to avoid</h3>

                <h4>Can my puppy eat bones?</h4>
                <p>
                  Adult dogs may be fed raw bones (<a
                    href="https://storage.googleapis.com/discover/are-raw-bones-safe-for-dogs"
                  >
                    although there can be some risks involved
                  </a>), but avoid giving your puppy bones of any kind. Puppy
                  teeth tend to be more fragile and can be damaged by chewing
                  bones, plus young puppies have been known to inadvertently
                  swallow chicken wings and other small bones whole!
                </p>

                <h4>What human foods are safe for dogs?</h4>
                <p>
                  As a general rule, it is best to limit the amount of human
                  food you feed your pup to help keep their diet balanced and
                  prevent obesity in later life. In particular avoid feeding
                  human foods which are known to be toxic to dogs including
                  grapes, sultanas, chocolate, caffeine, macadamia nuts,
                  avocado, garlic, onions and artificial sweeteners (xylitol).

                      Puppies have a habit of getting dirty, so you'll need to
                      keep some gentle shampoo on standby. As a general rule,
                      aim to bathe your puppy about once every 2 weeks or so
                      from the time you bring them home. Bathing your pup very
                      frequently may dry out their skin which can cause itching
                      or flaking. Look for a

                      Medium and long haired breed puppies will need to be
                      brushed daily to prevent knots and matts from forming.
                      They'll also need to get used to having their coats
                      clipped to keep things neat and tidy. Start getting your
                      puppy used to being groomed, handled and having their
                      nails trimmed as soon as you bring them home; this will
                      make life much easier for you and any dog groomers in the
                      long run!

                    <h3>Positive pet parenting</h3>

                    <p>
                      Positive or reward based behavioural training is widely
                      accepted to be the most effective and enjoyable way to
                      encourage dogs to behave in the ways that we want. This
                      concept really hinges on capturing and rewarding desirable
                      behaviours (with food and praise) while ignoring
                      undesirable ones.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Contrary to popular belief, attempting to stop unwanted
                      behaviours by yelling, picking up or interacting with your
                      dog in any way can actually encourage them; your dog may
                      well see any form of attention as positive reinforcement.
                      Of course the use of physical force such as hitting,
                      kicking or smacking is also not considered an appropriate
                      or humane way to train a dog.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the case of negative behaviours with dogs and puppies,
                      the best approach is to 'shape' their behaviour by
                      redirecting them away from the undesirable behaviour (eg.
                      barking at the neighbours) towards a learned desirable
                      behaviour (eg. sitting quietly on a mat). While it can
                      take time and patience, positive pet parenting will help
                      your dog to learn how to behave and interact with people
                      and other animals appropriately without damaging your
                      relationship or causing distress, anxiety or pain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      A handy mantra for positive pet parenting is to
                      <b>train the dog you want</b>
                      - acknowledge and reward behaviours you desire in your
                      dog, ignore and reshape the behaviours that you don't
                      desire.

                    <p>
                      The key to successful toilet training is consistency and
                      patience. You will need to take your puppy outside to the
                      area where you would prefer them to toilet a lot, ideally
                      every 2 hours for young pups! A good rule of thumb is to
                      take your pup to the toilet whenever they wake up from a
                      nap, after eating or drinking, after play sessions or if
                      they are showing signs that they need to go such as
                      sniffing around the ground in circles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When you take your pup out to the toilet, avoid the
                      temptation to play with them, simply give a command like
                      'go wee' and wait patiently for a few minutes. Reward your
                      puppy with plenty of praise every time they do the right
                      thing. Remember that you'll need to get up during the
                      night too in the early months to avoid any accidents in
                      the house. I told you this would be hard work!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When (not if) your pup has a toilet training accident in
                      the house, don't scold them or rub their nose in it as
                      this will only breed anxiety and fear. Simply clean up the
                      mess without delay, using an

                      puppy back to that spot to toilet next time.

                      There's no two ways about it, puppies love to chew and it
                      is likely that you will lose at least a couple of beloved
                      shoes to your furry little chew monster. Chewing is a
                      normal behaviour for puppies and adult dogs, so if you
                      don't provide an appropriate outlet, like chew toys, your
                      pup is likely to go looking for something else around the
                      house to satisfy their urges.

                    <p>
                      To discourage problem chewing in dogs and puppies try to
                      redirect their chewing to a chew toy, offering lots of
                      praise when they do the right thing! Have a selection of
                      different chew toys on hand that you can rotate every few
                      days to keep your pup from getting bored. If your dog
                      doesn't seem interested in the toys, sometimes a little

                      </a>
                      for problem chewers, but bear in mind while these sprays
                      may deter your dog from chewing a particular object, you
                      still need to address the underlying behaviour. In adult
                      dogs destructive chewing is usually motivated by boredom
                      or lack of appropriate chewing alternatives. Giving your
                      puppy lots of toys to stimulate their mind will help keep
                      them out of mischief, it's also a lot easier than spraying

                  15.3. How to stop your puppy biting
                </h2>

                      Biting and mouthing behaviour in puppies is very common.
                      While it can be cute and tolerable to be 'mauled' by a
                      10kg puppy, I can guarantee it's not so appealing in a
                      fully grown 30kg adult! So how can you nip this
                      undesirable behaviour in the bud? (pun intended)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the early months of life your puppy is still learning
                      how to socialise and interact appropriately with other
                      dogs and humans. Redirecting mouthing or biting by
                      providing
                      <a
                        href="https://storage.googleapis.com/toys/puppy/rubber"
                      >
                        appropriate chew toys
                      </a>
                      is one strategy to help limit this behaviour. If your
                      puppy starts to chew on your hands while you are playing,
                      redirect his or her attention to a toy, rewarding with
                      lots of quiet praise if they start to play with it. Keep
                      in mind that as your puppy gets very excited, he or she is
                      more likely to start biting and mouthing again so keep
                      play sessions short.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You may also need to teach your puppy bite inhibition.
                      This essentially involves teaching them that humans don't
                      like to be bitten. To do this, when your pup starts to
                      bite or nip immediately remove your attention from them by
                      standing up and walking away for a minute. In order for
                      this to work everyone in the household needs to be
                      consistent, so that your puppy learns biting results in
                      playtime being over and attention being withdrawn. It is
                      important to avoid yelling at or smacking puppies when
                      they bite, as this can result in fear and anxiety that may
                      cause other behavioural problems to appear.

                      Your puppy can start to learn basic commands and manners
                      as soon as he or she comes home. Putting in the hours now
                      will potentially save you a lot of heartache later on.
                      Obedience training is about more than just making your dog
                      do things on command; it provides mental stimulation,
                      strengthens the human animal bond and can be used to
                      redirect your dog's focus from undesirable behaviours.

                      Crate training is a way to create a safe, personal space
                      for your dog in your home. It draws on your dog's natural
                      instincts to create a den, a safe refuge in which to sleep
                      and hide. Although adult dogs may be able to be crate
                      trained, the ideal time to start is when your dog is a
                      puppy.

                      Crate training offers a lot of practical benefits and can
                      be particularly useful with puppies as an aid to toilet
                      training and preventing destructive or undesirable
                      behaviours.

                      The first 14 to 16 weeks of your puppy's life is when they
                      will be most open to new experiences and is often referred
                      to as the 'socialisation window'. Socialising your puppy
                      involves exposing them to lots of different environments,
                      things, people and animals
                      <b>in a positive and safe way</b>
                      to help them have the best chance of being well adjusted

                      As this window coincides with the period of time in which
                      your puppy may not have full immunity and protection from
                      their vaccinations, it's crucial to choose the location of
                      any socialisation very wisely. This is particularly
                      important for avoiding

                  Socialising your puppy effectively is more than just chucking
                  them in the deep end at the dog park! Negative experiences at
                  any time during their development can stick with a puppy well
                  into adulthood, so being beaten up by the local dog park bully
                  is not going to help your puppy play well with others later
                  on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To socialise your pup, get in touch with your local vet or dog
                  trainer about puppy preschool classes. Puppy preschool offers
                  a safe, supervised environment where your puppy can meet and
                  play with other pups (and usually learn a few basic obedience
                  skills and healthcare tips too!). If you have friends or
                  family members with healthy, fully vaccinated, well socialised
                  dogs you could also ask them to come around for a puppy
                  playdate, just be sure to keep an eye on things to make sure
                  the play doesn't get out of hand.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As well as other dogs, try to expose your puppy to as many
                  different people (including the postie and tradesmen and women
                  in uniform), sounds (such as the vacuum cleaner or thunder) in
                  a calm, friendly and non overwhelming environment as you can
                  during this socialisation window.

                    Puppyhood is something to be enjoyed because they grow up
                    quickly! With a little knowledge, preparation and patience
                    you can set your pup up for many happy years as a loved and
                    cherished family member.
